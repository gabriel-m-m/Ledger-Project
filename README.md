# CPSC210 Personal Project

## IOU (_I owe you_)

### General Information

This application will take a list of names, and will create
a ledger. Allowing users to record and add or subtract amounts 
of money they are owed or owe to other people. The application can be used by anyone, 
from within groups of friends, to between organizations. This will allow the user
to keep a record of who owes who and how much.  

This project is of interest to me as occasionally, within my group of friends, 
the issue of someone owing someone else money can arise. With one or both people forgetting
about it, it can take a while before this is ever paid back. An application such as this could 
record these amounts so that the information regarding what is owed is easily accessible.
