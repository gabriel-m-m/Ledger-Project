# CPSC210 Personal Project

## IOU (_I owe you_)

### General Information

This application will take a list of names, and will create
a ledger. Allowing users to record and add or subtract amounts 
of money they are owed or owe to other people. The application can be used by anyone, 
from within groups of friends, to between organizations. This will allow the user
to keep a record of who owes who and how much.  

This project is of interest to me as occasionally, within my group of friends, 
the issue of someone owing someone else money can arise. With one or both people forgetting
about it, it can take a while before this is ever paid back. An application such as this could 
record these amounts so that the information regarding what is owed is easily accessible. 

### User Stories:  

- As a user, I want to be able to add names to the ledger  
- As a user, I want to be able to pay off someone (who I owe) an amount of money  
- As a user, I want to be able to set an amount of money owed to me by another person  
- As a user, I want to be able to see a summary of what is owed by which people  
- As a user, I want to be able to balance out the amounts owed  
(e.g. if P1 owes P2 $10, and P2 owes P1 $3, then P1 owes P2 $7)
